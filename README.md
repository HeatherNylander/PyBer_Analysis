# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of Project

Using Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type will be created. Using Pandas and Matplotlib, a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type will be made. Finally, a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer will be submitted. 

- Deliverable 1: A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
- Deliverable 2: A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type
- Deliverable 3: A written report for the PyBer analysis (README.md)

## Results

### Deliverable 1: 
| City Type Stats <img width=1000/>  | Analysis <img width=1000/> |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| <img src="https://github.com/HeatherNylander/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/images/city_type_stats.png" > | **City Types** <br /> 	• Rural: Fewer rides and drivers but teh average fare per trip and driver are substantially higher. <br /> 	• Suburban: Rides and number of drivers is between that of rural and urban cities. <br /> 	• Urban: Far more rides and drivers but average trip seems to be shorter. <br /> <br />|

### Deliverable 2: 
| City Type Stats <img width=1000/>  | Analysis <img width=1000/> |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| <img src="https://github.com/HeatherNylander/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/images/city_type_graph.png" > | **The city types seem to follow similar trends for peak times over the course of these four months. **  <br /> <br />|


## Summary 
There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types
#### Recommendations
1. Drivers in urban cities are making less money per ride so an analysis of yearly earnings per driver would help to determine whether there is a disparity among driver earnings by city type.
2. Hiring more drivers in rural and suburban cities could increase total rides in those city types.
3. An analysis should be done to determine total time per ride to determine if the lower cost per ride in urban cities is impacted by traffic etc.
